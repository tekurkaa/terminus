    - *Tier 3 (3 pts)*: Analyst upgrades & price target hikes, Macro sector tailwinds, Pre-earnings whispers.
  - **Exponential Recency Decay Model**: Multiplies catalyst score by $e^{-0.08 \times \text{hours}}$, prioritizing breaking news (< 1h) while fading articles over 48 hours to prevent stale news from distorting scores.
  - **Source Credibility Weighting**: Tiered multipliers from 1.0× (WSJ, Bloomberg, Reuters, FT, CNBC) down to 0.5× for generic aggregators.
  - **News Velocity Bonus**: Awards an additional +3 points when $\ge 3$ articles cover the same security in a 4-hour window, capturing institutional media convergence.
  - **SEC EDGAR 8-K Monitor**: Real-time inspection of official SEC submissions (`data.sec.gov`) detecting material catalysts *before* broad dissemination.
  - **Finnhub Earnings Calendar**: Identifies upcoming earnings dates within 14 days, awarding pre-earnings momentum bonuses.

- **AI Breakout Thesis & Conviction Engine (Google Gemini 3.8 Flash)**:
  - Formulates institutional 1-2 sentence trade theses directly synthesizing real breaking headlines, catalyst drivers, technical setup, and volume confirmation.
  - Computes quantitative conviction scores (1–10) and catalyst classifications (*FDA Approval*, *Mega M&A*, *Pre-Earnings Squeeze*, *AI Inflection*, *Commercial Deal*, *Institutional Accumulation*).
  - Highlights trade theses and breaking news cards (with live article links, recency badges, and velocity tags) directly in the terminal UI and embeds them in daily HTML email digests.
- **Configurable Delivery Schedule & Live Tracking**:
  - **Customizable Delivery Time**: Select pre-market (08:30 AM ET, 09:15 AM ET), market open (09:30 AM ET), post-market (04:15 PM ET, 04:30 PM ET), or specify any custom minute (`HH:MM`).
  - **Timezone Awareness & UTC Rollover Guard**: Scheduler converts current time to the user's local timezone (via Python `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo`) and validates against local calendar dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`), preventing premature duplicate sends caused by UTC midnight rollover.
  - **Live Next-Run Indicator**: Real-time badge in the Email Alerts block displaying exact next scheduled dispatch (`Tomorrow, Oct 5 at 8:30 AM EDT`) and last delivery status.
  - **Precision Cron Scheduler**: 60-second polling loop with 12-hour minimum-interval safety guard.

- **Dedicated "DIVIDENDS" Tab**: Seamlessly positioned between Watchlist and Stock News, delivering an institutional upcoming ex-dividend schedule, payment dates, dividend rates, and an interactive **12-Month Projected Cash Flow Distribution** grid without cluttering the main portfolio overview.
- **Automated Backend Split & Merge Engine**: Built directly into portfolio capital calculations. Evaluates historical split events (e.g. NVDA 10:1 forward split, reverse split merges) against lot purchase dates to automatically adjust share counts and cost bases ($Q \times M$, $\text{Cost} / M$), conserving total deployed capital while ensuring P/L and valuations reflect live market reality.
- **Portfolio Risk & Diversification Auditor**: Single-asset dual-alert exposure thresholds (hard ceilings for crypto blue chips vs altcoins vs stocks), 20% sector concentration rules, health score scoring, and projected annual dividend cash flow KPIs.
- Real-time P&L calculations, historical equity curves (1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y, 5Y, ALL), and interactive allocation treemaps.
- Instant demo portfolio generation with 12 diversified tech, semi, ETF, and crypto positions.

### 7. 📈 Institutional Single-Stock Terminal Modal
- **Multi-Timeframe Interactive Charts**: Real-time quotes and intraday/historical charts across **`1D`**, **`1W`**, **`1M`**, **`1Y`**, and **`5Y`** intervals powered by Recharts with dynamic gain/loss area gradients.
- **Off-Hours & Low-Liquidity Intraday Resilience**: Multi-tier chart fallback engine: if 1D intraday interval is empty (e.g. market closed, weekend, or micro-cap equity), automatically extracts the most recent completed market session from a 5-day window, or daily bars, ensuring charts always render without blank states.
- **Visual Range Gauges**: High-contrast sliders displaying current price relative to **Day Low / High** and **52-Week Range**.
- **Institutional Key Metrics Grid**: Market Cap, Trailing P/E, Forward P/E, Beta (5Y), Day Open, Previous Close, Volume, and Dividend Yield with safe null/NaN defensive parsing.
- **Company Profile & Overview (Cloud-Resilient Metadata)**: Official descriptive company name and full business summary with expandable profile text. Incorporates a multi-tier fallback architecture combining Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage `OVERVIEW`, and an institutional master security directory in `asset_metadata_service.py` to guarantee official descriptive names and complete overview cards for equities, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies without bare symbol repetition or missing summaries even under datacenter IP restrictions.
- **Universal Cross-Tab Click Triggers**: Accessible anywhere a symbol appears across the entire terminal:
  - **Top Ticker Bar** & **Holdings Table**
  - **Watchlist Tab**
  - **Breakout Scanner Tab** (candidate symbols)
  - **Alpha Signals Tab** (directional models & options flow sweeps)
  - **Stock News Tab** (clickable article ticker tags)
  - **Sentiment Tab** (per-ticker sentiment breakdown cards)
  - **Insider Flow Tab** (congressional trades & top insider tickers)
  - **AI Chat Assistant Tab** (interactive extracted ticker chips)
  - **Portfolio Risk Auditor Tab** (trimmable asset chips & profit taking recommendations)
  - **Portfolio Charts Tab** (interactive allocation treemap tiles)

- **Executive & Macro News Briefs**: Real-time AI executive summaries synthesizing key portfolio news and macroeconomic trends via high-throughput, low-latency reasoning models.
- **Auto-Ticker Extraction & Conversation Lifecycle**: Thread persistence, automated conversation creation/deletion, and clickable ticker references.

### 9. 🗄️ Dual-Mode Database Architecture
- **Zero-Friction Local Mode**: Automatically detects if MongoDB is running; if not available, gracefully falls back to an embedded JSON document store (`backend/data/local_storage.json`) within 1 second without hanging.
- **Production Mode**: Seamlessly switches to Cloud MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas) when `MONGO_URL` is configured.

### 10. 🎨 Institutional Design System & Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AAA)
- **Accessible Navigation & Tab Semantics**: All 10 navigation tabs and sub-tab switchers feature explicit `aria-current="page"` indicators for screen readers and high-contrast `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-amber-500` rings for keyboard navigation.
- **Accessible Forms & Input Affordances**: Visible, uppercase monospace `<label htmlFor="...">` associations across trading and auth forms, native `type="email"` autofill, and descriptive `aria-label` tags on all icon-only action buttons.
- **Motion Safety (`prefers-reduced-motion`)**: Fully respects user motion preferences across all animations, pausing ticker marquees and disabling price flash pulses and tab fade transitions.
- **Terminal Depth & Numerical Alignment**: Enhanced panel elevation with inset highlight shadows (`.panel-raised`), vertical column alignment with `.tabular-nums` across tables and KPI cards (Watchlist, Dividends, Holdings), tactile press feedback (`active:scale-[0.97]`), custom dark Recharts tooltips, and safe inline two-step confirmation for destructive actions without native blocking dialogs.
- **Dialog Accessibility & Keyboard Trapping**: Complete `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`, and global `Escape` key dismissal across all modal surfaces (`StockDetailModal`, `DisclaimerModal`, `HowItWorksModal`, `CongressDrawer`).
- **Color-Independent Directional & Risk Encoding (WCAG 1.4.1)**: Directional indicators (`▲` / `▼`) alongside numeric values and explicit shape markers (`▲` High Exposure, `■` Warning, `●` Optimal) on risk badges so color is never the sole semantic differentiator.
- **Treemap Micro-Holding Aggregation**: Smart aggregation of positions accounting for <1% of the portfolio into an "OTHER (<1%)" bucket, preventing squished slivers and preserving aspect ratio visual clarity.
- **Full Skeleton Loading Pipeline**: Pulse-animated terminal skeleton loaders across historical charts and macro/stock news feeds that eliminate layout shifts during data fetches.
- **SVG & Visual Bar Accessibility**: Native SVG font styling ensuring monospace numbers across all browser engines, accompanied by `role="progressbar"` semantic attributes (`aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`) on composite scores, sentiment meters, and sector allocation bars.

### 11. 🔐 Native Google Identity Services & Account Isolation
- **Direct Google OAuth 2.0**: Native integration with Google Identity Services (GIS) using official Google Client ID credentials, eliminating third-party proxy intermediaries.
- **Account Chooser Popup & Instant Session**: Clicking "Continue with Google" opens Google's native account chooser directly over the application without full-page navigation. Google ID tokens and access tokens are verified server-side against Google's public tokeninfo endpoints (`/api/auth/google`).
- **Complete Per-User Data Isolation**: Portfolios, watchlists, trade history, and custom scanner preferences are strictly partitioned per authenticated Google account in MongoDB.
- **Developer & Trader Quick Login**: Fallback instant email/trader authentication (`/api/auth/dev-login`) for rapid local development and automated CI/CD runs.

## ☁️ Deployment Guide

### Deploy Frontend to Vercel
1. Import repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).
2. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
3. Set **Framework Preset** to `Create React App`.
4. **No additional env vars needed** — `frontend/.env.production` is committed and automatically points to the Render backend.
   - If you redeploy the backend under a different URL, update `frontend/.env.production` accordingly.
5. Click **Deploy**.

### Deploy Backend to Render / Railway / Fly.io
1. Create a new Web Service pointing to `backend/`.
2. Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start Command: `uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
4. Set Environment Variables on Render:
   ```env
   MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   DB_NAME=portfolio_manager
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://<your-frontend-domain>.vercel.app
   COOKIE_SECURE=true
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key_here
   NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   RESEND_FROM=Terminus <onboarding@resend.dev>
   ```

> **Important**: `COOKIE_SECURE=true` is required on Render because the frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) are on different domains. This sets the cookie to `samesite=none; Secure`, which is necessary for cross-origin cookie acceptance. The app also uses `Authorization: Bearer` header-based auth as a fallback, so even if cookies are blocked by the browser, sessions will still work.
